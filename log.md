# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 2, 2017
#### Today's Progress
* [GitHub](https://github.com/stvnrlnd/100-days-of-code): Forked the official #100DaysOfCode challenge repo and started a log for myself.
* [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/stvnrlnd): Completed 27 exercises, finishing the HTML and CSS section.
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/stvnrlnd): Completed 14 exercises of Learn HTML, finishing the introductory section.

#### Thoughts
It’s been a great day for refreshing myself on the basics of web development with HTML and CSS. I had tried out both freeCodeCamp and Codecademy a few times before — even deleting and recreating my Codecademy account to start over — but I’m really enjoying how the content has matured and grown over the years.

The concepts I focused on most heavily today were the structure of an HTML document and styling HTML elements with multiple CSS methods.


### Day 2: November 3, 2017
#### Today's Progress
* [GitHub](https://github.com/stvnrlnd/100-days-of-code): Cloned the #100DaysOfCode challenge repo that I forked yesterday onto my local machine to make it easier for me to keep up with it.
* [Github](https://github.com/stvnrlnd) & [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-api-using-node-and-express-4): Followed the tutorial and started building a RESTful API using Node and Express 4.
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/stvnrlnd): Completed 17 exercises today, finishing the Common Elements section of Learn HTML.

#### Thoughts
The day started off slow and I had trouble convincing myself to do anything, but once I did, it was hard to stop. I got some exercises on Codecademy done and started working on recreating a Scotch.io project.

### Day 3: November 4, 2017
#### Today's Progress
* [GitHub](https://github.com/stvnrlnd/100-days-of-code): Updated log with progress from 03-11-2017.
* [Github](https://github.com/stvnrlnd) & [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-api-using-node-and-express-4): Followed the tutorial and finsihed building a RESTful API using Node and Express 4.

#### Thoughts
I've been heavily distracted with a work situation for most of the day, but taking the time to sit down and code for a while has really improved my mood and state of mind. Today I finished up the Scotch.io RESTful API tutorial and got my log for yesterday updated. Scotch.io is a great resource for people of all skill levels, I love how well they break down tough concepts and how they take the time to explain why something works, and not just how to make it work.
