#### Thoughts
It’s been a great day for refreshing myself on the basics of web development with HTML and CSS. I had tried out both freeCodeCamp and Codecademy a few times before — even deleting and recreating my Codecademy account to start over — but I’m really enjoying how the content has matured and grown over the years.

The concepts I focused on most heavily today were the structure of an HTML document and styling HTML elements with multiple CSS methods.
